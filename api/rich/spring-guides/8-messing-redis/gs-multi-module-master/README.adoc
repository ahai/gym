This guide shows you how to create a multi-module project with Spring Boot. The project
will have a library jar and a main application that uses the library. You could also
use it to see how to build a library (that is, a jar file that is not an application) on
its own.

== What You Will Build

You will set up a library jar that exposes a service for simple "`Hello, World`" messages
and then include the service in a web application that uses the library as a dependency.

== Create a Root Project

This guide walks through building two projects, one of which is a dependency to the other.
Consequently, you need to create two child projects under a root project. But first, create
the build configuration at the top level. For Maven you will want a `pom.xml` with `<modules>`
listing the subdirectories:

====
[src,xml]
----
include::complete/pom.xml[]
----
====

For Gradle, you will want a `settings.gradle` including the same directories:

====
[src,groovy]
----
include::complete/settings.gradle[]
----
====

and (optionally) you could include an empty `build.gradle` (to help IDEs identify the root directory).


=== Create the Directory Structure

In the directory that you want to be your root directory, create the following
subdirectory structure (for example, with `mkdir library application` on *nix systems):

    └── library
    └── application

In the root of the project, you will need to set up a build system, and this guide shows
you how to use Maven or Gradle.

[#initial]
== Create the Library Project

One of the two projects serves as a library that the other project (the application) will
use.

=== Create the Directory Structure

In a the `library` directory, create the following subdirectory structure (for example,
by using `mkdir -p src/main/java/com/example/multimodule/service` on *nix systems):

    └── src
        └── main
            └── java
                └── com
                    └── example
                        └── multimodule
                            └── service

Now you need to configure a build tool (Maven or Gradle). In both cases, note that the
Spring Boot plugin is *not* used in the library project at all. The main function of the
plugin is to create an executable "`über-jar`", which we neither need nor want for a
library.

Although the Spring Boot Maven plugin is not being used, you do want to take advantage of
Spring Boot dependency management, so that is configured by using the
`spring-boot-starter-parent` from Spring Boot as a parent project. An alternative would be
to import the dependency management as a Bill of Materials
https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies[(BOM)]
in the `<dependencyManagement/>` section of the `pom.xml` file.

[#setting-up-the-library-project]
=== Setting up the Library Project

For the Library project, you need not add dependencies. The basic `spring-boot-starter`
dependency provides everything you need.

You can get a Maven build file with the necessary dependencies directly from the https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.4.3.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=com.example&artifactId=multi-module-library&name=multi-module-library&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.multi-module-library[Spring Initializr].
The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file that is created when you choose Maven:

====
[src,xml]
----
include::initial/library/pom.xml[]
----
====

You can get a Gradle build file with the necessary dependencies directly from the https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.4.3.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=com.example&artifactId=multi-module-library&name=multi-module-library&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.multi-module-library[Spring Initializr].
The following listing shows the `build.gradle` file that is created when you choose Gradle:

====
[src,java]
----
include::initial/library/build.gradle[]
----
====

==== Adjusting the Library Project

If you generated the Library project from `start.spring.io` it will contain a wrapper script
for the build system (`mvnw` or `gradlew` depending on the choice you made). You can move that
script and its associated configuration up to the root directory:

[source]
----
$ mv mvnw* .mvn ..
$ mv gradlew* gradle ..
----

The Library project has no class with a main method (because it is not an application).
Consequently, you have to tell the build system to not try to build an executable jar for
the Library project. (By default, the Spring Initializr builds executable projects.)

To tell Maven to not build an executable jar for the Library project, you must remove the
following block from the `pom.xml` created by the Spring Initializr:

====
[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----
====

The following listing shows the final `pom.xml` file for the Library project:

====
[src,xml]
----
include::complete/library/pom.xml[]
----
====

To tell Gradle to not build an executable jar for the Library project, you must add the
following blocks to the `build.gradle` created by the Spring Initializr:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
bootJar {
	enabled = false
}

jar {
	enabled = true
}
----
====

The `bootJar` task tries to create an executable jar, and that requires a `main()` method.
As a result, you need to disable the `bootJar` task and enable the `jar` task (which
creates an ordinary jar rather than an executable jar).

The following listing shows the final `build.gradle` file for the Library project:

====
[src,java]
----
include::complete/library/build.gradle[]
----
====

== Create a Service Component

The library will provide a `MyService` class that can be used by applications. The
following listing (from
`library/src/main/java/com/example/multimodule/service/MyService.java`) shows the
`MyService` class:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/library/src/main/java/com/example/multimodule/service/MyService.java[]
----
====

To make it configurable in the standard Spring Boot idiom (with `application.properties`),
you can also add a `@ConfigurationProperties` class. The `ServiceProperties` class (from
`library/src/main/java/com/example/multimodule/service/ServiceProperties.java`) fills that
need:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/library/src/main/java/com/example/multimodule/service/ServiceProperties.java[]
----
====

You need not do it this way. A library might merely provide pure Java APIs and no Spring
features. In that case, the application that consumes the library would need to provide
the configuration itself.

== Testing the Service Component

You will want to write unit tests for your library components. If you provide re-usable
Spring configuration as part of the library, you might also want to write an integration
test, to make sure that the configuration works. To do that, you can use JUnit and the
`@SpringBootTest` annotation. The following listing (from
`library/src/test/java/com/example/multimodule/service/MyServiceTest.java`) shows how to
do so:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/library/src/test/java/com/example/multimodule/service/MyServiceTest.java[]
----
====

NOTE: In the preceding listing, we have configured the `service.message` for the test by
using the default attribute of the `@SpringBootTest` annotation. We do *not* recommend
putting `application.properties` in a library, because there might be a clash at runtime
with the application that uses the library (only one `application.properties` is ever
loaded from the classpath). You *could* put `application.properties` in the test classpath
but not include it in the jar (for instance, by placing it in `src/test/resources`).

== Create the Application Project

The Application project uses the Library project, which offers a service that other
projects can use.

=== Create the Directory Structure

In the `application` directory, create the following subdirectory structure (for
example, with `mkdir -p src/main/java/com/example/multimodule/application` on *nix
systems):

    └── src
        └── main
            └── java
                └── com
                    └── example
                        └── multimodule
                            └── application

Do not use the same package as the library (or a parent of the library package) unless you
want to include all Spring components in the library by `@ComponentScan` in the
application.

[#setting-up-the-application-project]
=== Setting up the Application Project

For the Application project, you need the Spring Web and Spring Boot Actuator
dependencies.

You can get a Maven build file with the necessary dependencies directly from the https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.4.2.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.example&artifactId=multi-module-application&name=multi-module-application&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.multi-module-application&dependencies=web,actuator[Spring Initializr].
The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file that is created when you choose Maven:

====
[src,xml]
----
include::initial/application/pom.xml[]
----
====

You can get a Gradle build file with the necessary dependencies directly from the https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.4.2.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.example&artifactId=multi-module-application&name=multi-module-application&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.multi-module-application&dependencies=web,actuator[Spring Initializr].
The following listing shows the `build.gradle` file that is created when you choose Gradle:

====
[src,java]
----
include::initial/application/build.gradle[]
----
====

You can delete the `mvnw` and/or `gradlew` wrappers and their associated configuration files:

[source]
----
$ rm -rf mvnw* .mvn
$ rm -rf gradlew* gradle
----

==== Adding the Library Dependency

The Application project needs to have a dependency on the Library project. You need to
modify your Application build file accordingly.

For Maven, add the following dependency:

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>library</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
----
====

The following listing shows the finished `pom.xml` file:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/application/pom.xml[]
----
====

For Gradle, add the following dependency:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
implementation project(':library')
----
====

The following listing shows the finished `build.gradle` file:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/application/build.gradle[]
----
====

== Write the Application

The main class in the application can be a `@RestController` that uses the `Service` from
the library to render a message. The following listing (from
`application/src/main/java/com/example/multimodule/application/DemoApplication.java`)
shows such a class:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/application/src/main/java/com/example/multimodule/application/DemoApplication.java[]
----
====

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/spring-boot-application-new-path.adoc[]

Because `DemoApplication` is inside a different package
(`com.example.multimodule.application`) than `MyService`
(`com.example.multimodule.service`), `@SpringBootApplication` cannot automatically detect
it. There are different ways to let `MyService be picked up:

* Import it directly with `@Import(MyService.class)`.
* Fetch everything from its package by using
`@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackageClasses={...})`.
* Specifying the parent package by name: `com.example.multimodule`. (This guide uses this
  method)

NOTE: If your application also uses JPA or Spring Data, the `@EntityScan` and
`@EnableJpaRepositories` (and related) annotations inherit only their base package from
`@SpringBootApplication` when not explicitly specified. That is, once you specify
`scanBasePackageClasses` or `scanBasePackages`, you might also have to also explicitly use
`@EntityScan` and `@EnableJpaRepositories` with their package scans explicitly configured.

== Create the `application.properties` File

You need to provide a message for the service in the library in `application.properties`.
In the source folder, you need to create a file named
`src/main/resources/application.properties`. The following listing shows a file that would
work:

====
[source, java]
----
include::complete/application/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----
====

== Test the Application

Test the end-to-end result by starting the application. You can start the application in
your IDE or use the command line. Once the application is running, visit the client
application in the browser, at `http://localhost:8080/`. There, you should see
`Hello, World` reflected in the response.

If you use Gradle, the following command (really two commands run in sequence) will first
build the library and then run the application:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew build && ./gradlew :application:bootRun
----
====

If you use Maven, the following command (really two commands run in sequence) will first
build the library and then run the application:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw install && ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl application
----
====
== Summary

Congratulations! You have used Spring Boot to create a re-usable library and then used
that library to build an application.
