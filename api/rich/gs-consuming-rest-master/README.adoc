This guide walks you through the process of creating an application that consumes a
RESTful web service.

== What You Will Build

You will build an application that uses Spring's `RestTemplate` to retrieve a random
Spring Boot quotation at https://quoters.apps.pcfone.io/api/random.

== What You Need

:java_version: 1.8

== Starting with Spring Initializr

If you use Maven, visit the https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.4.3.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=com.example&artifactId=consuming-rest&name=consuming-rest&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.consuming-rest&dependencies=web[Spring Initializr] to generate a new project with the required dependency (Spring Web).

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file created when you choose Maven:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::initial/pom.xml[]
----
====

If you use Gradle, visit the https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.4.3.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=com.example&artifactId=consuming-rest&name=consuming-rest&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.consuming-rest&dependencies=web[Spring Initializr] to generate a new project with the required dependency (Spring Web).

The following listing shows the `build.gradle` file created when you choose Gradle:

====
[source,gradle]
----
include::initial/build.gradle[]
----
====
These build files can be this simple because `spring-boot-starter-web` includes everything
you need to build a web application, including the Jackson classes you need to work with
JSON.

=== Manual Initialization (optional)

If you want to initialize the project manually rather than use the links shown earlier, follow the steps given below:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring Web*.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

== Fetching a REST Resource

With project setup complete, you can create a simple application that consumes a RESTful
service.

A RESTful service has been stood up at https://quoters.apps.pcfone.io/api/random.
It randomly fetches quotations about Spring Boot and returns them as JSON documents.

If you request that URL through a web browser or curl, you receive a JSON document
that looks something like this:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2script]
----
{
   type: "success",
   value: {
      id: 10,
      quote: "Really loving Spring Boot, makes stand alone Spring apps easy."
   }
}
----
====

That is easy enough but not terribly useful when fetched through a browser or through curl.

A more useful way to consume a REST web service is programmatically. To help you with that
task, Spring provides a convenient template class called {RestTemplate}[`RestTemplate`].
`RestTemplate` makes interacting with most RESTful services a one-line incantation. And it
can even bind that data to custom domain types.

First, you need to create a domain class to contain the data that you need. The following
listing shows the `Quote` class, which you can use as your domain class:

`src/main/java/com/example/consumingrest/Quote.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/consumingrest/Quote.java[]
----

This simple Java class has a handful of properties and matching
getter methods. It is annotated with `@JsonIgnoreProperties` from the Jackson JSON
processing library to indicate that any properties not bound in this type should be ignored.

To directly bind your data to your custom types, you need to specify the
variable name to be exactly the same as the key in the JSON document returned from the API.
In case your variable name and key in JSON doc do not match, you can use `@JsonProperty`
annotation to specify the exact key of the JSON document. (This example matches each
variable name to a JSON key, so you do not need that annotation here.)

You also need an additional class, to embed the inner quotation itself. The `Value` class
fills that need and is shown in the following listing (at
`src/main/java/com/example/consumingrest/Value.java`):

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/consumingrest/Value.java[]
----
====

This uses the same annotations but maps onto other data fields.

== Finishing the Application

The Initalizr creates a class with a `main()` method. The following listing shows the
class the Initializr creates (at
`src/main/java/com/example/consumingrest/ConsumingRestApplication.java`):

====
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/consumingrest/ConsumingRestApplication.java[]
----
====

Now you need to add a few other things to the `ConsumingRestApplication` class to get it to
show quotations from our RESTful source. You need to add:

* A logger, to send output to the log (the console, in this example).
* A `RestTemplate`, which uses the Jackson JSON processing library to process the incoming
data.
* A `CommandLineRunner` that runs the `RestTemplate` (and, consequently, fetches our
quotation) on startup.

The following listing shows the finished `ConsumingRestApplication` class (at
`src/main/java/com/example/consumingrest/ConsumingRestApplication.java`):

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/consumingrest/ConsumingRestApplication.java[]
----
====

== Running the Application

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]

You should see output similar to the following but with a random quotation:

....
2019-08-22 14:06:46.506  INFO 42940 --- [           main] c.e.c.ConsumingRestApplication           : Quote{type='success', value=Value{id=1, quote='Working with Spring Boot is like pair-programming with the Spring developers.'}}
....

NOTE: If you see an error that reads, `Could not extract response: no suitable
HttpMessageConverter found for response type [class com.example.consumingrest.Quote]`, it
is possible that you are in an environment that cannot connect to the backend service
(which sends JSON if you can reach it). Maybe you are behind a corporate proxy. Try
setting the `http.proxyHost` and `http.proxyPort` system properties to values appropriate
for your environment.

== Summary
Congratulations! You have just developed a simple REST client by using Spring Boot.
